# Syberia fix

## black screen
1. run 
```bash
sh fix-black-screen.sh PATH_TO_YOUR_STEAM_LIBRARY_FOLDER
```

2. go to steam > right click on the game > properties > compatibility

3. check `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool` or something like this

4. select `Proton 5.13-6`

Unfortunately the game works in window mode only.
