# My linux games

This repo contains some fixes that I've made for my linux games and related tools.

By default, I'm using `lutris` to manage all these games and tools, so if you don't have it installed [click here](https://lutris.net/).
However, Some changes can also be made using the [heroic games launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/), [steam runtime](https://store.steampowered.com/), or other tools. So, make sure you to follow the instructions from the tutorial.

## required tools

These tools you need to have installed to run the fix scripts:

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Recommended tools

These are general tools that may help you to do some fixes:

- [wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- [winetricks](https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks)
- [protonUp-QT](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/)
- [steam runtime](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [heroic games launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)

Some old games may require:

- [dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/)
- [dosbox staging](https://dosbox-staging.github.io/)
- [scummvm](https://www.scummvm.org/)
- [luxtorpeda](https://github.com/dreamer/luxtorpeda)
- [roberta](https://github.com/dreamer/roberta)
- [boxtron](https://github.com/dreamer/boxtron)

In other cases, it's a good a idea to install the windows version of a launcher, so check the [lutris runners](https://lutris.net/games) and some `wine tutorials` for that. A simpler way to run these applications is using [bottles](https://usebottles.com/), a way to run individual instances of a wine application.

Besides that, it's a good idea to have a good text editor, here are some options that You could check:

- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
